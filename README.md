Dataset:-
The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper
The Use of multiple measurements in Taxonomic Problems. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson
collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The data set consists of 50 samples
from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the
length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.
This dataset became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as support vector
machines.

Objective:-
The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on
their measurements. Now, imagine that you have the measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species.
Your objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris
flowers into their respective species.
Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal
measurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks.
